## [2.2.0] - 2026-01-14

### Added
- **Batch Reordering API**: Implemented `/api/admin/repos/reorder` endpoint to replace N+1 PATCH calls with a single batch operation.
- **Settings Context**: Created `SettingsProvider` to manage global site preferences (`showProjectImages`, `projectViewMode`).
- **useFetch Hook**: Standardized data fetching across components, replacing manual `useEffect` fetch logic.
- **IST Date Utilities**: Centralized timezone handling in `lib/date.ts` with `formatIST` helper.
- **ProviderComposer**: New utility component to flatten nested provider trees in `layout.tsx`.
- **Database Indexes**: Added indexes on `Repo.featured` and `Repo.hidden` for optimized filtering.
- **Rate Limiting Middleware**: Centralized rate limiting in `middleware.ts` with configurable limits per route pattern.

### Changed
- **Component Decomposition**: Split monolithic components for better maintainability:
  - `ProjectsGrid.tsx` → `GridControls`, `SpotlightSection`, `MoreProjectsSection`
  - `TerminalPage.tsx` → `TerminalWelcome`, `TerminalHistory`, `MobileKeyboardHelpers`
  - `NewspaperPage.tsx` → `NewspaperHeader`, `ActivityTicker`, `EditionArticle`, `NewspaperStats`, `ProjectsTable`
- **Terminal Admin**: Consolidated redundant state logic into `useTerminalAdmin` hook.
- **Masthead Styling**: Standardized font sizes and spacing in `NewspaperPage` header.
- **Provider Nesting**: Refactored `layout.tsx` to use `ProviderComposer` pattern instead of 7-level deep nesting.
- **Code Centralization**: Moved `formatProjectTitle` utility from 3 files to shared `lib/utils.ts`.

### Fixed
- **Session Validation**: Strengthened `/api/newspaper/active` to properly validate session tokens, not just cookie existence.
- **CSRF Protection**: Added `validateCsrf` helper to sensitive POST/PATCH endpoints.
- **Rate Limit Memory Leak**: Fixed potential memory leak in `auth.ts` where expired entries weren't purged before limit check.
- **Timezone Inconsistency**: Fixed newspaper generation and display dates that previously used system time, causing streak calculation bugs.
- **Project Card Mapping**: Added missing fields (`imageSource`, `customDescription`) in repository mapping logic.
- **Personality Modal**: Renamed confusing "Confirm Assignment" button to "Back to Desk".
- **Dead Code Cleanup**: Removed obsolete manual `localStorage` and unused variable comments.
- **Stale Tests**: Removed 5 test cases for deleted commands (`fortune`, `cowsay`, `sl`, `date`, `neofetch`). All 106 tests now pass.
- **State Sync Bug**: Fixed `ProjectsGrid.tsx` effect that could overwrite local edits when `adminData` refreshed during editing.

### Security
- **AUTH_SECRET**: Re-configured to require defined value in production environments.

## [2.1.5] - 2026-01-13
 
### Added
- **AI Personalities**: Introduced "Skye", the AI News Agent with 4 distinct personas (Tabloid, Senior Dev, Scholar, Hacker).
- **Personality Manager**: New UI modal to switch between AI personalities dynamically.
- **Context Engine V2**: 
    - **Hybrid Memory**: Combines historical portfolio data (Dormant, Featured, Oldest) with real-time daily activity.
    - **Time Awareness**: Enforced GMT+5:30 (IST) for accurate "Daily Update" tracking and "Vibe" checks.
- **Admin Refresh**: Improved GitHub sync logic to transactionally update Repos, Commits, and Activity events.

### Changed
- **Newspaper UI**: Added dynamic "Personality" button to the masthead (Admin only).
- **Prompt Logic**: Removed opinionated "forced" narratives; the AI now relies purely on raw data and the selected persona.

### Fixed
- **Timezone Sync**: Fixed discrepancy where "Today's Commits" often missed late-night activity due to UTC drift.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-01-13

### Added
- **Premium Mobile Navigation**: Staggered link animations, backdrop blur, and page-aware theme mapping (Paper/News/Default).

- **Mobile Action Bar**: Dedicated sticky bar for Resume page with theme-aware PDF download and section jump menu.

### Changed
- **Mobile-First Layout**: Hero section now prioritizes animations over text on small screens.
- **Skills Section**: Reduced fade gradients on mobile for better visibility of active skills.
- **Project Cards**: Switched to `aspect-video` on mobile for better content fitting.
- **Identity Styling**: Standardized header identity text to use global theme behavior for better readability.

### Fixed
- **Resume Layout**: Restored desktop button structure and fixed hover color inversion (Token Sync).
- **Theming**: Resolved several theme-awareness regressions in Newspaper and Paper modes across different device types.
- **Overflow Issues**: Applied global `overflow-x-hidden` to prevent accidental horizontal scrolling on mobile.
